# Trace - Slack Incident Management

A lightweight Slack app that streamlines incident management by organizing the flow from events ‚Üí investigations ‚Üí incidents, with each investigation having its own dedicated Slack channel.

## What is Trace?

Trace helps teams manage incidents by:

- Creating dedicated Slack channels for each investigation
- Collecting evidence from across your workspace
- Escalating investigations to incidents when needed
- Tracking everything in one organized place

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîç **Dedicated Investigation Channels**

Each investigation gets its own Slack channel (e.g., `#trace-api-down-a3f`), keeping discussions organized and focused.

### üìé **Easy Evidence Collection**

Right-click any message in Slack to add it as evidence to an investigation - no copying and pasting required.

### üö® **Simple Incident Escalation**

Escalate investigations to incidents with one command, automatically setting the incident commander.

### üìä **Central Visibility**

All new investigations are announced in your designated channel (e.g., `#potential-issues`) for team awareness.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Secure by Default**

External users from connected workspaces are automatically blocked from using commands, protecting your incident data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation Requirements

- A Slack workspace with admin permissions
- PostgreSQL database
- Node.js 18+ (for self-hosting)

### Quick Start

1. **Create a Slack App**

   - Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
   - Click "Create New App" ‚Üí "From manifest"
   - Copy the manifest from `manifest.yml` in this repo
   - Install the app to your workspace

2. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   # Create a PostgreSQL database
   createdb trace_production
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   ```bash
   # Required
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/trace_production
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
   SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token
   POTENTIAL_ISSUES_CHANNEL_ID=C123456789  # Channel ID for notifications

   # Optional
   ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_IDS=T123456,T789012  # Restrict to specific workspaces
   ```

4. **Deploy the app**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run prisma:migrate deploy
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## üìñ How to Use Trace

### Basic Commands

All commands start with `/trace`:

| Command                       | Description                    | Where to Use                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `/trace create [description]` | Create a new investigation     | Any channel                 |
| `/trace list`                 | View all active investigations | Any channel                 |
| `/trace status`               | Show investigation details     | Investigation channels only |
| `/trace incident`             | Escalate to incident           | Investigation channels only |
| `/trace resolve`              | Mark incident as resolved      | Investigation channels only |
| `/trace close`                | Close the investigation        | Investigation channels only |
| `/trace help`                 | Show available commands        | Any channel                 |

### Typical Workflow

1. **Something happens** (alert, customer report, monitoring notification)

   ```
   /trace create API response times increasing
   ```

2. **Trace creates a dedicated channel** (e.g., `#trace-api-respons-a3f`)

   - You're automatically added to the channel
   - A summary is posted to your notification channel

3. **Collect evidence**

   - Right-click any relevant message ‚Üí "Add to Investigation"
   - Messages are linked in the investigation channel

4. **If it's serious, escalate**

   ```
   /trace incident
   ```

   - This marks it as an active incident
   - Sets you as the incident commander

5. **When service is restored**

   ```
   /trace resolve
   ```

6. **After follow-up is complete**
   ```
   /trace close
   ```

### Adding Evidence

To add any Slack message as evidence:

1. Hover over the message
2. Click the three dots (‚ãØ) menu
3. Select "Add to Investigation"
4. Choose the investigation (if multiple are active)

The message will be linked in the investigation channel with context about who added it and when.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Trace is designed to be simple and reliable:

- **Runs in Socket Mode**: No public URL needed, works behind firewalls
- **Stateless handlers**: Each command is independent
- **PostgreSQL storage**: Reliable data persistence
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe and maintainable
- **Comprehensive tests**: 80%+ code coverage

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **External user protection**: Users from other Slack workspaces (via Slack Connect) are automatically blocked
- **No message content storage**: Only stores links to messages, not the content itself
- **Input validation**: All user input is sanitized
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents abuse (60 requests/minute per user)
- **Workspace isolation**: Investigations are completely isolated to your workspace

| `POTENTIAL_ISSUES_CHANNEL_ID` | Yes      | Channel ID for investigation notifications     |
| `ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_IDS`       | No       | Comma-separated list of allowed workspace IDs  |
| `NODE_ENV`                    | No       | Set to `production` for production deployments |

### Customization

You can customize Trace by:

- Changing the notification channel (set `POTENTIAL_ISSUES_CHANNEL_ID`)
- Restricting to specific workspaces (set `ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_IDS`)
- Modifying the channel naming pattern in `src/utils/nameGenerator.ts`

## üìä What Gets Tracked

Trace stores minimal data:

- Investigation metadata (title, status, timestamps)
- Links to Slack messages (not the content)
- User IDs of who created/modified investigations
- Channel IDs for investigation channels
